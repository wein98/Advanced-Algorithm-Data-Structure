# Advanced-Algorithm-Data-Structure
Algorithms that I have worked on in Advanced Algorithm and Data Structure course in Monash Malaysia.

All the codes are purely built and written by myself, by referring to random resources.
The files naming are not consistent with the context below, I will reorganize them when I have the time :D
Test modules are not built with these codes, efficiency are not confirmed yet. I will make them if I have time :D

Context:
- Gusfield's Z-algorithm
- Boyer Moore's algorithm
- Boyer Moore's algorithm (mirrored version)
- Ukkonen's suffix tree
